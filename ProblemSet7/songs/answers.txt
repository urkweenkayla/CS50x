If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you
characterize their audio aura?

The songs score an average of 0.66 in energy, 0.72 in danceability, and 0.5 in valence. I
would characterize their audio aura as flexible in mood due to the more neutral valence
score (purple - able to shift and change), and energetic and fun due to the higher energy
and danceability scores (orange).

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative
of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I think that taking the average valence to find the mood of the listener might be too
quick to flatline something more dynamic. I'm inclined to separate songs based on valence
scores of 0-0.5 and 0.51-1 (this could be further refined by splitting the scores more
like 0-0.25, etc.), then look at the energy and danceability of group 1 and group 2, to
get a picture of the character of music listened to that reflects a more "negative" mood
and that reflects a more "positive" mood. After that, I would take the percent of songs
that each group represents of the total songs, and the color of each group to create a
gradient spectrum. For example, if group 1 was green and 30% of the songs and group 2
was blue and 70% of the songs, the image of the "aura" would be 30% green and 70% blue.
